## Hi there 👋

I'm Jayson, a student studying IT.
I'm interested to learn more about coding!

I learned the basics of Html, CSS, Python, a bit of PHP on frontend,
and MySQL for backend!
(Leaned from school!)
I'm currently looking for a company for my OJT subject!

Going to add more description in the future!(because I don't know what to display here...) 

  Fun facts about me!
  
● I like anime(ReCreators is my fav)

● Likes to read Light Novels and Manga	

● Plays games!(mostly mobile)
